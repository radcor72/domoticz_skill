This skill is for controlling Domoticz with the source voice assistant Mycroft.


Requirements
------------

-  `Python3`_.
-  `Domoticz`_.
-  `Mycroft`_.


Configuration
-------------

Devices configuration file is back... for me it seems useful specially for users speaking other languages and to avoid same notation in this skill and in Domoticz server.
Put your configuration in the file “what-where.cfg”.

Located in : domoticz_skill/what-where.cfg
The principle is to put the 'what' followed by the 'where' separated by a hyphen :

'what-where' = idx
idx is the device number in Domoticz.

examples :

- temperature-living room = 1 
- flood sensor-bathroom = 2
- all lights-house = 3
- Light-Living room = 4

Mycroft Settings Page
-----
Configuration for server IP and login details can be now set in Mycroft account, under Domoticz skill - when installed it will be listed there.
The default settings for the domoticz connection and configuration is the local host without
authentication.
The settings can be also manually changed in file "settings.json" located in domoticz_skill/settings.json

Usage
-----

In English :

examples device names:

-  Living room light
-  Outside temperature
-  Front door lock

example phrases:

-  Hey Mycroft turn on the living room light
-  Hey Mycroft what is the outside temperature?
-  Hey Mycroft lock the front door
-  Hey Mycroft dim the dining room dimmer 50%


Todo
----

Sync server properties to Mycroft settings.
